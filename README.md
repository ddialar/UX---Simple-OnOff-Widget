# Widget OnOff

When we are developing a mobile UI, we usually need to use an On-Off switch in order to set or unset some specific parameter. This way, there are a lot of technics to do that however, with this code, I am implementing a lingth, quick and easy to use widget which can be adapted to a lot of situations.

This code is implemented with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and the only dependency is the jQuery v1.11.2 library (I could have done the full code with pure Javascript but I prefered to use that library in order to save time).

Through the next link, you will be able to check a demo of this code.

I hope that this code will be useful for you.
